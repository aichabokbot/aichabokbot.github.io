  Data Science master student @ Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris. Passionate about solving business problem using data science techniques.
  <br><br>
  My master’s program in Data Science allowed to gain a strong theoretical background in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Analytics and Statistics. I had the chance to apply this background through various data projects and through a 5-month internship at Untienots last spring. Interning at Untienots confirmed my interest in data science and allowed me to enhance my technical skills and to work in a big data environment with the constraints related to real-life datasets and computing resources. Through all these experiences, I learned to quickly adapt myself to new situations and to continuously update my technical skills.
